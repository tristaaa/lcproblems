## | Sum problems
### 1.1 Two Sum
 - Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.
 - You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
 - **Example:**
    ```python
    Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

    Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
    return [0, 1].
    ```

### 1.2 Three Sum
 - Given an array nums of n integers, are there elements a, b, c in nums such that a + b + c = 0? 
 - Find all unique triplets in the array which gives the sum of zero.
 - Note: The solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.
 - **Example:**
    ```python
    Given array nums = [-1, 0, 1, 2, -1, -4],

    A solution set is:
    [
      [-1, 0, 1],
      [-1, -1, 2]
    ]
    ```
