## | Sum problems
#### 1.1 Two Sum
 - Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.
 - You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
 - **Example:**
    ```python
    Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

    Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
    return [0, 1].
    ```

#### 1.2 Three Sum

#### 1.3 Four Sum
