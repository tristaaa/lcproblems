## | Sum problems
### 1.1 Two Sum
#### -two sum (basic)
 - Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.
 - You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
 - **Example:**
    ```python
    Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

    Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
    return [0, 1].
    ```
 - [twosum](https://github.com/tristaaa/lcproblems/blob/master/twosum.py)

#### -two sum (input array sorted)
 - Given an array of integers that is already sorted in ascending order, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number.
 - The function twoSum should return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target, where index1 must be less than index2.
 - Note: 
  - Your returned answers (both index1 and index2) are not zero-based.
  - You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution and you may not use the same element twice.
 -  **Example:**
    ```python
    Input: numbers = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
    Output: [1,2]
    Explanation: The sum of 2 and 7 is 9. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 2.
    ```
 - [twosumII](https://github.com/tristaaa/lcproblems/blob/master/twosumii.py)

#### -two sum (design a data structure)
 - Design and implement a TwoSum class. It should support the following operations: `add` and `find`.
 - `add`: Add the number to an internal data structure.
 - `find`: Find if there exists any pair of numbers which sum is equal to the value.
 - **Example:**
    ```python
    add(1)
    add(3)
    add(5)
    find(4) # return True
    find(7) # return False
    ```
 - [twosumIII](https://github.com/tristaaa/lcproblems/blob/master/twosumiii.py)

#### -two sum (input is a binary search tree)
 - Given a Binary Search Tree and a target number, return true if there exist two elements in the BST such that their sum is equal to the given target.
 -  **Example:**
    ```python
    Input: 
        5
       / \
      3   6
     / \   \
    2   4   7

    Target = 9

    Output: True
    ```
 - [twosumIV](https://github.com/tristaaa/lcproblems/blob/master/twosumiv.py)


### 1.2 Three Sum
#### -three sum (basic)
 - Given an array nums of n integers, are there elements a, b, c in nums such that a + b + c = 0? 
 - Find all unique triplets in the array which gives the sum of zero.
 - Note: The solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.
 - **Example:**
    ```python
    Given array nums = [-1, 0, 1, 2, -1, -4],

    A solution set is:
    [
      [-1, 0, 1],
      [-1, -1, 2]
    ]
    ```
 - [3sum](https://github.com/tristaaa/lcproblems/blob/master/threesum.py)

#### -three sum closest
 - Given an array nums of n integers and an integer target, find three integers in nums such that the sum is closest to target. 
 - Return the sum of the three integers. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.
 - **Example:**
    ```python
    Given array nums = [-1, 2, 1, -4], and target = 1.

    The sum that is closest to the target is 2. (-1 + 2 + 1 = 2).
    ```
 - [3sumClosest](https://github.com/tristaaa/lcproblems/blob/master/threesumclosest.py)

#### -three sum smaller
 - Given an array of n integers `nums` and a target, find the number of index triplets `(i,j,k)` with `0<=i<j<k<n` that satisfy the condition: `nums[i]+nums[j]+nums[k] < target`.
 - **Example:**
    ```python
    Input: nums = [-2,0,1,3], and target = 2
    Output: 2
    Explanation: Because there are two triplets which sums are less than 2:
        [-2,0,1]
        [-2,0,3]
    ```
 - [3sumSmaller](https://github.com/tristaaa/lcproblems/blob/master/threesumsmaller.py)



### 1.3 Four Sum
#### -four sum (basic)
 - Given an array nums of n integers and an integer target, are there elements a, b, c, and d in nums such that a + b + c + d = target? 
 - Find all unique quadruplets in the array which gives the sum of target.
 - Note: The solution set must not contain duplicate quadruplets.
 - **Example:**
    ```python
    Given array nums = [1, 0, -1, 0, -2, 2], and target = 0.

    A solution set is:
    [
      [-1,  0, 0, 1],
      [-2, -1, 1, 2],
      [-2,  0, 0, 2]
    ]
    ```
 - [4sum](https://github.com/tristaaa/lcproblems/blob/master/foursum.py)
    - a general solution for all numbers of N sum using two pointers

#### -four sum count
 - Given four lists A, B, C, D of integer values, compute how many tuples (i, j, k, l) there are such that A[i] + B[j] + C[k] + D[l] is zero.
 - To make problem a bit easier, all A, B, C, D have same length of N where 0 ≤ N ≤ 500. All integers are in the range of -228 to 228 - 1 and the result is guaranteed to be at most 231 - 1.
 - **Example:**
    ```python
    Input:
    A = [ 1, 2]
    B = [-2,-1]
    C = [-1, 2]
    D = [ 0, 2]

    Output:
    2

    Explanation:
    The two tuples are:
    1. (0, 0, 0, 1) -> A[0] + B[0] + C[0] + D[1] = 1 + (-2) + (-1) + 2 = 0
    2. (1, 1, 0, 0) -> A[1] + B[1] + C[0] + D[0] = 2 + (-1) + (-1) + 0 = 0
    ```

## | Stack problems
### 2.1 Binary Search Tree Iterator
 - Implement an iterator over a binary search tree (BST). Your iterator will be initialized with the root node of a BST.
 - Calling `next()` will return the next smallest number in the BST.
 - Note: 
  - `next()` and `hasNext()` should run in average O(1) time and uses O(h) memory, where h is the height of the tree.
  - You may assume that `next()` call will always be valid, that is, there will be at least a next smallest number in the BST when `next()` is called.
 - **Example:**
    ```python
    Input: 
        7
       / \
      3   15
         /  \
        9   20

    BSTIterator iterator = new BSTIterator(root);
    iterator.next();    # return 3
    iterator.next();    # return 7
    iterator.hasNext(); # return True
    iterator.next();    # return 9
    iterator.hasNext(); # return True
    iterator.next();    # return 15
    iterator.hasNext(); # return True
    iterator.next();    # return 20
    iterator.hasNext(); # return False
    ```

## | Add problems
### 3.1 Add Two Numbers
#### -add two number (reversed linked list)
 - You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order and each of their nodes contain a single digit. 
 - Add the two numbers and return it as a linked list.
 - You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.
 - **Example:**
    ```python
    Input: (2 -> 4 -> 3) + (5 -> 6 -> 4)
    Output: 7 -> 0 -> 8
    Explanation: 342 + 465 = 807.
    ```
 - [addTwoNumbers](https://github.com/tristaaa/lcproblems/blob/master/addtwonum.py)

#### -add two number (not reversed linked list)
 - You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The most significant digit comes first and each of their nodes contain a single digit. Add the two numbers and return it as a linked list.
 - You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.
 - Note: What if you cannot modify the input lists? In other words, reversing the lists is not allowed.
 - **Example:**
    ```python
    Input: (7 -> 2 -> 4 -> 3) + (5 -> 6 -> 4)
    Output: 7 -> 8 -> 0 -> 7
    ```
 - [addTwoNumbersII](https://github.com/tristaaa/lcproblems/blob/master/addtwonumii.py)

#### -add to array
 - For a non-negative integer `X`, the array-form of `X `is an array of its digits in left to right order.  For example, if `X` = 1231, then the array form is [1,2,3,1].
 - Given the array-form `A` of a non-negative integer `X`, return the array-form of the integer `X+K`.
 - Note: 
  - 1 <= A.length <= 10000
  - 0 <= A[i] <= 9
  - 0 <= K <= 10000
  - If A.length > 1, then A[0] != 0
 - **Example:**
    ```python
    Input: A = [1,2,0,0], K = 34
    Output: [1,2,3,4]
    Explanation: 1200 + 34 = 1234

    Input: A = [9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9], K = 1
    Output: [1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]
    Explanation: 9999999999 + 1 = 10000000000
    ```
 - [addToArray-formOfInt](https://github.com/tristaaa/lcproblems/blob/master/add2arrayformofint.py)

#### -add binary strings
 - Given two binary strings, return their sum (also a binary string).
 - The input strings are both non-empty and contains only characters 1 or 0.
 - **Example:**
    ```python
    Input: a = "11", b = "1"
    Output: "100"

    Input: a = "1010", b = "1011"
    Output: "10101"
    ```
 - [addBinary](https://github.com/tristaaa/lcproblems/blob/master/addbinary.py)

#### -add integer strings
 - Given two non-negative integers `num1` and `num2` represented as string, return the sum of `num1` and `num2`.
 - Note: 
  - The length of both num1 and num2 is < 5100.
  - Both num1 and num2 contains only digits 0-9.
  - Both num1 and num2 does not contain any leading zero.
  - You must not use any built-in BigInteger library or convert the inputs to integer directly.
 - [addStrings](https://github.com/tristaaa/lcproblems/blob/master/addstrings.py)

#### -add integer using bit manipulation
 - Calculate the sum of two integers a and b, but you are not allowed to use the operator `+` and `-`.
 - **Example:**
    ```python
    Input: a = -2, b = 3
    Output: 1
    ```
 - [addTwoNumBitOps](https://github.com/tristaaa/lcproblems/blob/master/addtwonumBitOps.py)
  - Extension: [A summary: how to use bit manipulation to solve problems easily and efficiently](https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-of-two-integers/discuss/84278/A-summary%3A-how-to-use-bit-manipulation-to-solve-problems-easily-and-efficiently)

#### - ***multiply integer strings***
 - Given two non-negative integers num1 and num2 represented as strings, return the product of num1 and num2, also represented as a string.
 - **Example:**
    ```python
    Input: num1 = "123", num2 = "456"
    Output: "56088"
    ```
 - [multiplyNumbers](https://github.com/tristaaa/lcproblems/blob/master/multiplynum.py)


### 3.2 Add Digits
 - Given a non-negative integer num, repeatedly add all its digits until the result has only one digit.
 - Given a solution with O(1) running time.
 - **Example:**
    ```python
    Input: 38
    Output: 2 
    Explanation: The process is like: 3 + 8 = 11, 1 + 1 = 2. 
        Since 2 has only one digit, return it.
    ```
 - [addDigits](https://github.com/tristaaa/lcproblems/blob/master/adddigits.py)



## | Substring problems
### 4.1 Repeated Substring
 - Given a non-empty string check if it can be constructed by taking a substring of it and appending multiple copies of the substring together. 
 - You may assume the given string consists of lowercase English letters only and its length will not exceed 10000.
 - **Example:**
    ```python
    Input: "abab"
    Output: True
    Explanation: It's the substring "ab" twice.

    Input: "aba"
    Output: False
    ```
 - [repeatedSubstr](https://github.com/tristaaa/lcproblems/blob/master/isrepeatedsubstr.py) 


### 4.2 Longest Substring
#### -longest substring w/o repeating chars
 - Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.
 - **Example:**
    ```python

#### -longest palindromic substring 
 - Given a string s, find the longest palindromic substring in s. 
 - You may assume that the maximum length of s is 1000.
 - **Example:**
    ```python
    Input: "babad"
    Output: "bab"
    Note: "aba" is also a valid answer.

    Input: "cbbd"
    Output: "bb"
    ```

#### -longest substring w/ at least k repeating chars
  - Find the length of the longest substring T of a given string (consists of lowercase letters only) such that every character in T appears no less than k times.
  - **Example:**
    ```python
    Input: s = "aaabb", k = 3
    Output: 3

    The longest substring is "aaa", as 'a' is repeated 3 times.

    Input: s = "ababbc", k = 2
    Output: 5

    The longest substring is "ababb", as 'a' is repeated 2 times and 'b' is repeated 3 times.
    ```

### 4.3 Count Binary Substrings
 - Give a string s, count the number of non-empty (contiguous) substrings that have the same number of 0's and 1's, and all the 0's and all the 1's in these substrings are grouped consecutively.
 - Substrings that occur multiple times are counted the number of times they occur.
 - **Example:**
    ```python
    Input: "00110011"
    Output: 6
    Explanation: There are 6 substrings that have equal number of consecutive 1's and 0's: "0011", "01", "1100", "10", "0011", and "01".

    Notice that some of these substrings repeat and are counted the number of times they occur.

    Also, "00110011" is not a valid substring because all the 0's (and 1's) are not grouped together.
    ```

### 4.4 Unique Substrings in Wraparound String
 - Consider the string `s` to be the infinite wraparound string of "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz", so `s` will look like this: "...zabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcd....".
 - Now we have another string `p`. 
 - Your job is to find out how many unique non-empty substrings of `p` are present in `s`. 
 - In particular, your input is the string `p` and you need to output the number of different non-empty substrings of `p` in the string `s`.
 - Note: `p` consists of only lowercase English letters and the size of p might be over 10000.
 - **Example:**
    ```python
    Input: "a"
    Output: 1
    Explanation: Only the substring "a" of string "a" is in the string `s`.

    Input: "cac"
    Output: 2
    Explanation: There are two substrings "a", "c" of string "cac" in the string `s`.

    Input: "zab"
    Output: 6
    Explanation: There are six substrings "z", "a", "b", "za", "ab", "zab" of string "zab" in the string `s`.

### 4.5 Binary String W/ Substrings Representing 1-N
 - Given a binary string S (a string consisting only of '0' and '1's) and a positive integer N, return true if and only if for every integer X from 1 to N, the binary representation of X is a substring of S.
 - Note:
  - 1 <= len(S) <= 1000
  - 1 <= N <= 10^9
 - **Example:**
    ```python
    Input: S = "0110", N = 3
    Output: true

    Input: S = "0110", N = 4
    Output: false

## | Palindrome problems
### 5.1 Valid Palindrome 
#### -valid palindrome (basic) 
 - Given a string, determine if it is a palindrome, considering only alphanumeric characters and ignoring cases.
 - Note: For the purpose of this problem, we define empty string as valid palindrome.
 - **Example:**
    ```python
    Input: "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"
    Output: true
    ```
 - [validPalindrome](https://github.com/tristaaa/lcproblems/blob/master/palindromevalid.py)

#### -valid palindrome (can delete one char)
 - Given a non-empty string s, you may delete at most one character. 
 - Judge whether you can make it a palindrome.
 - Note: 
  - The string will only contain lowercase characters a-z. 
  - The maximum length of the string is 50000.
 - **Example:**
    ```python
    Input: "aba"
    Output: True

    Input: "abca"
    Output: True
    Explanation: You could delete the character 'c'.
    ```
 - [validPalindromeII](https://github.com/tristaaa/lcproblems/blob/master/palindromevalidii.py)


### 5.2 Palindrome Number
 - Determine whether an integer is a palindrome. An integer is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward.
- **Example:**
    ```python
    Input: 121
    Output: true

    Input: -121
    Output: false
    Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
    ```
 - [palindromeNumber](https://github.com/tristaaa/lcproblems/blob/master/palindromenum.py)


### 5.3 Palindrome Linked List
 - Given a singly linked list, determine if it is a palindrome.

    Output: True
    ```
 - [palindromell](https://github.com/tristaaa/lcproblems/blob/master/palindromell.py)


### 5.4 Longest Palindrome
 - Given a string which consists of lowercase or uppercase letters, find the length of the longest palindromes that can be built with those letters.
 - This is case sensitive, for example "Aa" is not considered a palindrome here.
 - Note: Assume the length of given string will not exceed 1,010.
 - **Example:**
    ```python
    Input: "abccccdd"

    Output: 7

    Explanation:
    One longest palindrome that can be built is "dccaccd", whose length is 7.
    ```
 - [longestPalindrome](https://github.com/tristaaa/lcproblems/blob/master/palindromelongest.py)


### 5.5 Prime Palindrome
 - Find the smallest prime palindrome greater than or equal to N.
 - Recall that a number is prime if it's only divisors are 1 and itself, and it is greater than 1. 
 - For example, 2,3,5,7,11 and 13 are primes.
 - Recall that a number is a palindrome if it reads the same from left to right as it does from right to left. 
 - For example, 12321 is a palindrome.
 - Note:
  - 1 <= N <= 10^8
  - The answer is guaranteed to exist and be less than 2 * 10^8.
 - **Example:**
    ```python
    Input: 6
    Output: 7

    Input: 8
    Output: 11

    Input: 13
    Output: 101
    ```

#### -palindrome partition (min cut)
 - Given a string s, partition s such that every substring of the partition is a palindrome.
 - Return the minimum cuts needed for a palindrome partitioning of s.
 - **Example:**
    ```python
    Input: "aab"
    Output:
    [
      ["aa","b"],
      ["a","a","b"]
    ]
    ```

### 5.7 Palindrome Permutation
#### -palindrome permutation (basic)
 - Given a string s, determine if a permutation of the string could form a palindrome.
 - **Example:**
    ```python
    Input: "aabb"
    Output: True

    Input: "abc"
    Output: False
    ```
 - [palindromePermutation](https://github.com/tristaaa/lcproblems/blob/master/palindromepermutation.py)

#### -palindrome permutation (list all possible ret)
 - Given a string s, return all the palindromic permutations (without duplicates) of it. 
 - Return an empty list if no palindromic permutation could be form.
 - Hint:
  - If a palindromic permutation exists, we just need to generate the first half of the string.
  - To generate all distinct permutations of a (half of) string, use a similar approach from: `Permutations II` or `Next Permutation`.
 - **Example:**
    ```python
    Input: "aabb"
    Output: ["abba","baab"]

    Input: "abc"
    Output: []

 - Given a string, count how many palindromic substrings in this string.
 - The substrings with different start indexes or end indexes are counted as different substrings even they consist of same characters.
 - Note: The input string length won't exceed 1000.
 - **Example:**
    ```python
    Input: "abc"
    Output: 3
    Explanation: Three palindromic strings: "a", "b", "c".

### 7. Find the Celebrity lc277
 - medium
 - Suppose you are at a party with n people (labeled from 0 to n - 1) and among them, there may exist one celebrity. The definition of a celebrity is that all the other n - 1 people know him/her but he/she does not know any of them.
 - Now you want to find out who the celebrity is or verify that there is not one. The only thing you are allowed to do is to ask questions like: "Hi, A. Do you know B?" to get information of whether A knows B. You need to find out the celebrity (or verify there is not one) by asking as few questions as possible (in the asymptotic sense).
 - You are given a helper function `bool knows(a, b)` which tells you whether A knows B. Implement a function `int findCelebrity(n)`. There will be exactly one celebrity if he/she is in the party. 
 - Return the celebrity's label if there is a celebrity in the party. If there is no celebrity, return -1.
 - Note:
    - The directed graph is represented as an adjacency matrix, which is an n x n matrix where a[i][j] = 1 means person i knows person j while a[i][j] = 0 means the contrary.
    - Remember that you won't have direct access to the adjacency matrix.
 - **Example:**
    ```python
    Input: graph = [
      [1,1,0],
      [0,1,0],
      [1,1,1]
    ]
    Output: 1
    Explanation: There are three persons labeled with 0, 1 and 2. graph[i][j] = 1 means person i knows person j, otherwise graph[i][j] = 0 means person i does not know person j. The celebrity is the person labeled as 1 because both 0 and 2 know him but 1 does not know anybody.

### 10. Bulls and Cows lc299
 - easy
 - You are playing the following Bulls and Cows game with your friend: 
    - You write down a number and ask your friend to guess what the number is. 
    - Each time your friend makes a guess, you provide a hint that indicates how many digits in said guess match your secret number exactly in both digit and position (called **"bulls"**) and how many digits match the secret number but locate in the wrong position (called **"cows"**). 
    - Your friend will use successive guesses and hints to eventually derive the secret number.
 - Write a function to return a hint according to the secret number and friend's guess, use `A` to indicate the bulls and `B` to indicate the cows. 
 - Note: 
    - both secret number and friend's guess may contain duplicate digits.
    - You may assume that the secret number and your friend's guess only contain digits, and their lengths are always equal.
 - **Example:**
    ```python
    Input: secret = "1807", guess = "7810"

    Output: "1A3B"

    Explanation: 1 bull and 3 cows. The bull is 8, the cows are 0, 1 and 7.

    Input: secret = "1123", guess = "0111"

    Output: "1A1B"

    Explanation: The 1st 1 in friend's guess is a bull, the 2nd or 3rd 1 is a cow.

### 11. Gas Station lc134
 - median
 - There are N gas stations along a circular route, where the amount of gas at station i is gas[i].(i begins at 0)
 - You have a car with an unlimited gas tank and it costs cost[i] of gas to travel from station i to its next station (i+1). You begin the journey with an empty tank at one of the gas stations.
 - Return the starting gas station's index if you can travel around the circuit once in the clockwise direction, otherwise return -1.
 - Note: 
    - If there exists a solution, it is guaranteed to be unique
    - Both input arrays are non-empty and have the same length
    - Each element in the input arrays is a non-negative integer
 - **Example:**
    ```python
    Input: 
    gas  = [1,2,3,4,5]
    cost = [3,4,5,1,2]

    Output: 3

    Explanation:
    Start at station 3 (index 3) and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4
    Travel to station 4. Your tank = 4 - 1 + 5 = 8
    Travel to station 0. Your tank = 8 - 2 + 1 = 7
    Travel to station 1. Your tank = 7 - 3 + 2 = 6
    Travel to station 2. Your tank = 6 - 4 + 3 = 5
    Travel to station 3. The cost is 5. Your gas is just enough to travel back to station 3.
    Therefore, return 3 as the starting index.

    Input: 
    gas  = [2,3,4]
    cost = [3,4,3]

    Output: -1

    Explanation:
    You can't start at station 0 or 1, as there is not enough gas to travel to the next station.
    Let's start at station 2 and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4
    Travel to station 0. Your tank = 4 - 3 + 2 = 3
    Travel to station 1. Your tank = 3 - 3 + 3 = 3
    You cannot travel back to station 2, as it requires 4 unit of gas but you only have 3.
    Therefore, you can't travel around the circuit once no matter where you start.

    Input: words = ["cat","bt","hat","tree"], chars = "atach"
    Output: 6
    Explanation: 
    The strings that can be formed are "cat" and "hat" so the answer is 3 + 3 = 6.

    Input: words = ["hello","world","leetcode"], chars = "welldonehoneyr"
    Output: 10
    Explanation: 
    The strings that can be formed are "hello" and "world" so the answer is 5 + 5 = 10.

### 15. H-index lc274
 - median
 - Given an array of citations (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a researcher, write a function to compute the researcher's h-index.
 - According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: "A scientist has index h if h of his/her N papers have at least h citations each, and the other N − h papers have no more than h citations each."
 - Note: If there are several possible values for h, the maximum one is taken as the h-index.
 - Hint: 
    - An easy approach is to sort the array first.
    - What are the possible values of h-index?
    - A faster approach is to use extra space.
 - **Example:**
    ```python
    Input: citations = [3,0,6,1,5]
    Output: 3 
    Explanation: [3,0,6,1,5] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively. 
        Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining two with no more than 3 citations each, her h-index is 3.

### 18.1 Contains Duplicate lc217
 - Easy
 - Given an array of integers, find if the array contains any duplicates.
 - Your function should return true if any value appears at least twice in the array, and it should return false if every element is distinct.
 - **Example:**
    ```python
    Input: [1,1,1,3,3,4,3,2,4,2]
    Output: True
    ```

### 18.2 Contains Duplicate II lc219
 - Easy
 - Given an array of integers and an integer k, find out whether there are two distinct indices i and j in the array such that nums[i] = nums[j] and the **absolute** difference between i and j is at most k.
 - **Example:**
    ```python
    Input: nums = [1,2,3,1], k = 3
    Output: True

    Input: nums = [1,2,3,1,2,3], k = 2
    Output: False
    ```

### 18.3 Contains Duplicate III lc219
 - Median
 - Given an array of integers, find out whether there are two distinct indices i and j in the array such that the absolute difference between nums[i] and nums[j] is at most t and the absolute difference between i and j is at most k.
 - **Example:**
    ```python
    Input: nums = [1,2,3,1], k = 3, t = 0
    Output: True

    Input: nums = [1,0,1,1], k = 1, t = 2
    Output: True

    Input: nums = [1,5,9,1,5,9], k = 2, t = 3
    Output: False
    ```
